# Outline

This Repository is for all assignments of **Group 8** of SOSC 4300 Computational Social Science in 2024 Spring.

## Homework Assignments 1
The assignment should be finished in the procedure in 3-fold: (1) **preparation**; (2) **first successful submission on Kaggle**; and (3) **performance improvement**.
### Preparation
- Familiarize with [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jtentor/blogfeedback-data-set).
- Understand how GitHub and especially how GitHub [branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) work. This is important because 40% grade depends on the performance improvement progress shown on GitHub.
- Decision to use R and Rmarkdown for documentation (Decided on March 8th, 2024).

### First successful submission on Kaggle 
- Regardless of performance, we firstly need to build a simple model that can load the data, run without bugs, and do some predictions.
- Finish this section no later than March 15th, 2024.

### Performance improvement
- Need to ask the course teaching team on the setting of the performance competition on Kaggle. Previous years' example on Kaggle could be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/2023-hkust-4300-5500-1/leaderboard).
- We need to do some testing, experiment, exploration, with the use of different methods, different parameters, and different split of the data to achieve the best results gradually.
- The key points here are not just the coding, but also the correct usage of GitHub branches.
- Due on March 24th, 2024.
